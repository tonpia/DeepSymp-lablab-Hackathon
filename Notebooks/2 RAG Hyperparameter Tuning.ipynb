Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9361438751220703}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"a7d9f167-f31f-4b13-a4ed-1f1006bbe66c\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"501599c0-0e4c-4e26-9100-3658e68139af\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"6775498bd1ea4ccd2872fef121238fe0722a1c51521b2f53696be7b3568095e4\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"54d10e28-12fc-4eef-b90e-efdc820172fd\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"db5ad70292912275329999c0dc5b83bbc9f68f37620f9e3ab7b66157a4f63a22\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"21c9aab8-438e-4063-8e09-16073e2e929f\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"e366b2cc1db49bfca2a6f5a5af634d3f7fc7d414d9d3575c3d950ede489334ea\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"Giving \\\\nO2 if breathless.

Inflammatory pain worsens after rest, increases at the middle of the night or particularly in the morning, may improve with exercise and is accompanied by morn-ing stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes and signs of acute inflammation (rubor, tumor, calor, dolor et functia laesa). Migratory pain (one joint becoming \\\\ninflamed as another subsides) usually happens in rheumatic fever, gonococ-cal arthritis, meningococcal arhtritis, viral arthritis, SLE, acute leukemia and Whipple\\\\u2019s disease. Episodic recurrent pain is characteristic of palindromic rheumatism, Lyme disease, crystal induced arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Whipple\\\\u2019s disease, familial Mediterranean fever, Still\\\\u2019s disease and SLE. Pain is disproportionately greater than effusion in rheumatic fever, \\\\nFamilial Mediterranean fever, acute leukemia and AIDS. Sinovial effusion is disproportionately greater than pain in tuberculosis arthritis, bacterial endo-carditis, IBD, giant cell arteritis and Lyme disease. Referred pain happens in the following conditions: disease of the cervical spine can present with shoulder pain, shoulder disease \\\\u2013 with upper arm pain, lumbar spine lesions \\\\u2013 with hip or thigh pain and hip disease \\\\u2013 with knee pain.\\\\nSwelling may be due to bony hypertrophy, synovitis, intra-articular fluid, \\\\nor a swollen periarticular structure.

Scleritis and episcleritis occur in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. An acutely painful, very red eye due to iritis occurs in axial spondyloarthritis (p. 262). The sclerae are blue in certain types of osteogenesis imperfecta (see Fig. 3.30A) and in the scleromalacia of longstanding rheumatoid arthritis.\\\\nGeneral features\\\\nWeight\\\\tloss,\\\\tmuscle\\\\tloss,\\\\tfever\\\\tand\\\\tlymphadenopathy \\\\tare\\\\tall\\\\t\\\\nfeatures of systemic involvement in inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue disease.General examination\\\\nSkin, nail and soft tissues\\\\nThe skin and related structures are common sites of associated lesions. The skin changes of psoriasis may be hidden, in the umbilicus, natal cleft or scalp (p. 286), for example. The rash of SLE is found across the cheeks and bridge of nose. Nail pitting and onycholysis occur in psoriasis (p. 24).\\\\nSmall, dark-red spots due to capillary infarcts occur in \\\\nrheumatoid arthritis, SLE and systemic vasculitis. Common sites are the nail folds (Fig. 13.5, often seen in rheumatoid arthritis), and the lower legs in systemic vasculitis (p. 288).\\\\nIn systemic sclerosis, the thickened, tight skin produces a \\\\ncharacteristic facial appearance (see Fig. 3.30C). In the hands, flexion contractures, calcium deposits in the finger pulps (Fig. 13.6) and tissue ischaemia leading to ulceration may occur. The telangiectasias of systemic sclerosis are purplish, blanch with pressure and are most common on the hands and face. In the \\\\nfingers, the pallor of Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon, pulp atrophy or \\\\nulceration may be evident.\\\\nReactive arthritis is associated with conjunctivitis, urethritis, \\\\ncircinate balanitis (painless superficial ulcers on the prepuce and glans) and superficial mouth ulcers.\\\\nNodules\\\\nThe firm, non-tender, subcutaneous nodules of rheumatoid arthritis most commonly occur on the extensor surface of the forearm (Fig. 13.7), sites of pressure or friction such as the sacrum or Achilles tendon, or in the lungs. Multiple small nodules can occur in the hands. Rheumatoid nodules are strongly associated with a positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody or rheumatoid factor.\\\\nBony nodules in osteoarthritis affect the lateral aspects of the \\\\nDIP joints (Heberden\\\\u2019s nodes) or the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints (Bouchard\\\\u2019s nodes, Fig. 13.8). They are smaller and harder than rheumatoid nodules.\\\\nGouty tophi are firm, irregular subcutaneous crystal collections \\\\n(monosodium urate monohydrate). Common sites are the olecranon bursa, helix of the ear and extensor aspects of the fingers (Fig. 13.9), hands, knees and toes. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2789, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.933597981929779}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"ec5dfdac-0afe-400d-b23e-e776b9df9e3a\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"142\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"420610ae-0f0f-4020-bbab-0089cd09810e\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"142\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"0477fdeed7078caf9be790db30e5e8e7b248fd525e6540da87816ffc8436862f\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"d6c35060-f149-481f-9de5-9fe0448f8152\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"142\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"e3abc33532087258b54d2a3736332fd489c2a5e7ef946fbb14cd6580f7c44811\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"dbfc2592-431e-439c-8eae-be654fae6b08\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"8efc51b24a7a4e0df68b98890caf715e4880c7fadd9a791dd1c91dc58ad47da4\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"Confirmed by:  swelling, redness, localized pain, malaise.\\\\nFinalized by the predictable outcome of  management, e.g.  \\\\nantibiotic effective against Streptococcus  or Staphylococcus , e.g. \\\\nbenzylpenicillin, etc. and flucloxacillin may be IV initially.\\\\nGout Suggested by:  severe joint redness, pain, and swelling, usually in \\\\none joint, commonly that of the big\\\\u00a0toe.\\\\nConfirmed by:  iserum uric acid  and the presence of urate \\\\ncrystals in joint fluid aspirate .\\\\nFinalized by the predictable outcome of  management, e.g.  \\\\nindometacin or, if contraindicated, colchicine to a maximum of 6mg \\\\nuntil pain disappears or side-effects appear. long term allopurinol.\\\\nThermal \\\\nburnSuggested by:  presence of blister, possibly with some erythema.\\\\nConfirmed by:  history of\\\\u00a0burn.\\\\nFinalized by the predictable outcome of  management, e.g.  relieve pain \\\\nwith sterile, waterproof dressing to prevent transpiration from \\\\ndamaged cells.

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9361438751220703}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"a7d9f167-f31f-4b13-a4ed-1f1006bbe66c\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"501599c0-0e4c-4e26-9100-3658e68139af\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"6775498bd1ea4ccd2872fef121238fe0722a1c51521b2f53696be7b3568095e4\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"54d10e28-12fc-4eef-b90e-efdc820172fd\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"db5ad70292912275329999c0dc5b83bbc9f68f37620f9e3ab7b66157a4f63a22\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"21c9aab8-438e-4063-8e09-16073e2e929f\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"e366b2cc1db49bfca2a6f5a5af634d3f7fc7d414d9d3575c3d950ede489334ea\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"Giving \\\\nO2 if breathless.

Sinovial effusion is disproportionately greater than pain in tuberculosis arthritis, bacterial endo-carditis, IBD, giant cell arteritis and Lyme disease. Referred pain happens in the following conditions: disease of the cervical spine can present with shoulder pain, shoulder disease \\\\u2013 with upper arm pain, lumbar spine lesions \\\\u2013 with hip or thigh pain and hip disease \\\\u2013 with knee pain.\\\\nSwelling may be due to bony hypertrophy, synovitis, intra-articular fluid, \\\\nor a swollen periarticular structure. Unlike tenderness, objective evidence of swelling indicates organic disease. In chronic rheumatic diseases impaired function is often due to a combination of pain, stiffness, tendon and joint damage, neurological impairment and muscle weakness.\\\\nA number of extrajoint manifestations can help to reveal the cause \\\\nof arthritis: Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon (in scleroderma and collagen vascu-\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 923, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2846, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9352035522460938}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"e8969937-2cb8-42fc-9076-f21c4250b371\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"833\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"d62a9af7-4e34-4c1f-b37a-a6abd2af4387\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"833\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"b76aa0438fed5cca1712c9a746cd1500d56f7230f7bcec4ab33378d0b7164286\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"53389caa-a6dc-4e1c-a817-6038f99c3239\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"832\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"16a47494976849239959e57818eedb3ee8ac490138904f789dfb263106e368f9\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"d2c98cb3-a2ce-40d5-a98a-9dff7e22dce4\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"4efdb0e878a4dfd1979fc6643037e98f2227d08bbfd2c98d63423f7dd19e0557\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"RHEUMATOLOGIC, IMMUNOLOGIC, & ALLERGIC DISORDERS \\\\n 833  CMDT 2024\\\\n3.

Scleritis and episcleritis occur in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. An acutely painful, very red eye due to iritis occurs in axial spondyloarthritis (p. 262).

The skin changes of psoriasis may be hidden, in the umbilicus, natal cleft or scalp (p. 286), for example. The rash of SLE is found across the cheeks and bridge of nose. Nail pitting and onycholysis occur in psoriasis (p. 24).\\\\nSmall, dark-red spots due to capillary infarcts occur in \\\\nrheumatoid arthritis, SLE and systemic vasculitis. Common sites are the nail folds (Fig. 13.5, often seen in rheumatoid arthritis), and the lower legs in systemic vasculitis (p. 288).\\\\nIn systemic sclerosis, the thickened, tight skin produces a \\\\ncharacteristic facial appearance (see Fig. 3.30C). In the hands, flexion contractures, calcium deposits in the finger pulps (Fig. 13.6) and tissue ischaemia leading to ulceration may occur. The telangiectasias of systemic sclerosis are purplish, blanch with pressure and are most common on the hands and face. In the \\\\nfingers, the pallor of Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon, pulp atrophy or \\\\nulceration may be evident.\\\\nReactive arthritis is associated with conjunctivitis, urethritis, \\\\ncircinate balanitis (painless superficial ulcers on the prepuce and glans) and superficial mouth ulcers.\\\\nNodules\\\\nThe firm, non-tender, subcutaneous nodules of rheumatoid arthritis most commonly occur on the extensor surface of the forearm (Fig. 13.7), sites of pressure or friction such as the sacrum or Achilles tendon, or in the lungs. Multiple small nodules can occur in the hands.

Ask about, and examine for, extra-articular features: skin and nail (see p 76) involvement (include scalp, hairline, umbilicus, genitalia, and natal cleft \\\\u2014psoriasis can easily be missed); eye signs (see p 560); lungs (eg \\\\ufb01 brosis) (see p 198); kidneys (see p 314); heart; GI (eg mouth ulcers, diarrhoea); GU (eg urethritis, genital ulcers); and CNS.

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules but are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi - tivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early history of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of synovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout. Spondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their course, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec - tion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and sacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic Lyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com - monly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic tests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably with Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a polyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is common, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and serologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec - tion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly - arthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for anti-CCP antibodies are negative. Malar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope - cia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or Smith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point to the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion - ally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these patients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have chiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the shoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused with RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can be avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the arthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially involves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually spares the small joints of the hand.

Referred pain happens in the following conditions: disease of the cervical spine can present with shoulder pain, shoulder disease \\\\u2013 with upper arm pain, lumbar spine lesions \\\\u2013 with hip or thigh pain and hip disease \\\\u2013 with knee pain. Swelling may be due to bony hypertrophy, synovitis, intra-articular fluid, or a swollen periarticular structure. Unlike tenderness, objective evidence of swelling indicates organic disease. In chronic rheumatic diseases impaired function is often due to a combination of pain, stiffness, tendon and joint damage, neurological impairment and muscle weakness. A number of extrajoint manifestations can help to reveal the cause of arthritis: Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon (in scleroderma and collagen vascu-\\\", \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": {}}, {\\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Received passage [6].\\\", \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": {}}, {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"[7] RHEUMATOLOGIC, IMMUNOLOGIC, & ALLERGIC DISORDERS 833 CMDT 2024 3. Ocular symptoms\\\\u2014 Dryness of the eyes, mouth, and other mucous membranes is found especially in advanced disease (see Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome). Other ocular manifesta - tions include episcleritis, scleritis (Figure 22\\\\u20135), scleroma - lacia due to scleral nodules, and peripheral ulcerative keratitis. 4. Other symptoms\\\\u2014 Interstitial lung disease is often asymptomatic and detected only by chest imaging, but it can be clinically significant in about 10% of patients. Peri - carditis and pleural disease are usually silent clinically, but symptomatic effusions can develop. Occasionally, a small- vessel vasculitis develops and manifests as tiny hemorrhagic infarcts in the nail folds or finger pulps. Necrotizing arteri - tis is well reported but rare. A small subset of patients with RA have splenomegaly and neutropenia (Felty syndrome), usually in the setting of untreated severe, destructive arthri - tis. Felty syndrome must be distinguished from large granu - lar lymphoproliferative disorder, with which it shares many features. B.

Scleritis and episcleritis occur in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. An acutely painful, very red eye due to iritis occurs in axial spondyloarthritis (p. 262). The sclerae are blue in certain types of osteogenesis imperfecta (see Fig. 3.30A) and in the scleromalacia of longstanding rheumatoid arthritis. General features Weight loss, muscle loss, fever and lymphadenopathy are all features of systemic involvement in inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue disease.General examination Skin, nail and soft tissues The skin and related structures are common sites of associated lesions. The skin changes of psoriasis may be hidden, in the umbilicus, natal cleft or scalp (p. 286), for example. The rash of SLE is found across the cheeks and bridge of nose. Nail pitting and onycholysis occur in psoriasis (p. 24). Small, dark-red spots due to capillary infarcts occur in rheumatoid arthritis, SLE and systemic vasculitis. Common sites are the nail folds (Fig. 13.5, often seen in rheumatoid arthritis), and the lower legs in systemic vasculitis (p. 288). In systemic sclerosis, the thickened, tight skin produces a characteristic facial appearance (see Fig. 3.30C). In the hands, flexion contractures, calcium deposits in the finger pulps (Fig. 13.6) and tissue ischaemia leading to ulceration may occur. The telangiectasias of systemic sclerosis are purplish, blanch with pressure and are most common on the hands and face. In the fingers, the pallor of Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon, pulp atrophy or ulceration may be evident. Reactive arthritis is associated with conjunctivitis, urethritis, circinate balanitis (painless superficial ulcers on the prepuce and glans) and superficial mouth ulcers.

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9361438751220703}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"a7d9f167-f31f-4b13-a4ed-1f1006bbe66c\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"501599c0-0e4c-4e26-9100-3658e68139af\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"6775498bd1ea4ccd2872fef121238fe0722a1c51521b2f53696be7b3568095e4\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"54d10e28-12fc-4eef-b90e-efdc820172fd\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"db5ad70292912275329999c0dc5b83bbc9f68f37620f9e3ab7b66157a4f63a22\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"21c9aab8-438e-4063-8e09-16073e2e929f\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"e366b2cc1db49bfca2a6f5a5af634d3f7fc7d414d9d3575c3d950ede489334ea\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"Giving \\\\nO2 if breathless.

Sinovial effusion is disproportionately greater than pain in tuberculosis arthritis, bacterial endo-carditis, IBD, giant cell arteritis and Lyme disease. Referred pain happens in the following conditions: disease of the cervical spine can present with shoulder pain, shoulder disease \\\\u2013 with upper arm pain, lumbar spine lesions \\\\u2013 with hip or thigh pain and hip disease \\\\u2013 with knee pain.\\\\nSwelling may be due to bony hypertrophy, synovitis, intra-articular fluid, \\\\nor a swollen periarticular structure. Unlike tenderness, objective evidence of swelling indicates organic disease. In chronic rheumatic diseases impaired function is often due to a combination of pain, stiffness, tendon and joint damage, neurological impairment and muscle weakness.\\\\nA number of extrajoint manifestations can help to reveal the cause \\\\nof arthritis: Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon (in scleroderma and collagen vascu-\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 923, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2846, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9352035522460938}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"e8969937-2cb8-42fc-9076-f21c4250b371\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"833\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"d62a9af7-4e34-4c1f-b37a-a6abd2af4387\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"833\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"b76aa0438fed5cca1712c9a746cd1500d56f7230f7bcec4ab33378d0b7164286\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"53389caa-a6dc-4e1c-a817-6038f99c3239\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"832\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"16a47494976849239959e57818eedb3ee8ac490138904f789dfb263106e368f9\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"d2c98cb3-a2ce-40d5-a98a-9dff7e22dce4\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"4efdb0e878a4dfd1979fc6643037e98f2227d08bbfd2c98d63423f7dd19e0557\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"RHEUMATOLOGIC, IMMUNOLOGIC, & ALLERGIC DISORDERS \\\\n 833  CMDT 2024\\\\n3.

Scleritis and episcleritis occur in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. An acutely painful, very red eye due to iritis occurs in axial spondyloarthritis (p. 262).

The skin changes of psoriasis may be hidden, in the umbilicus, natal cleft or scalp (p. 286), for example. The rash of SLE is found across the cheeks and bridge of nose. Nail pitting and onycholysis occur in psoriasis (p. 24).\\\\nSmall, dark-red spots due to capillary infarcts occur in \\\\nrheumatoid arthritis, SLE and systemic vasculitis. Common sites are the nail folds (Fig. 13.5, often seen in rheumatoid arthritis), and the lower legs in systemic vasculitis (p. 288).\\\\nIn systemic sclerosis, the thickened, tight skin produces a \\\\ncharacteristic facial appearance (see Fig. 3.30C). In the hands, flexion contractures, calcium deposits in the finger pulps (Fig. 13.6) and tissue ischaemia leading to ulceration may occur. The telangiectasias of systemic sclerosis are purplish, blanch with pressure and are most common on the hands and face. In the \\\\nfingers, the pallor of Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon, pulp atrophy or \\\\nulceration may be evident.\\\\nReactive arthritis is associated with conjunctivitis, urethritis, \\\\ncircinate balanitis (painless superficial ulcers on the prepuce and glans) and superficial mouth ulcers.\\\\nNodules\\\\nThe firm, non-tender, subcutaneous nodules of rheumatoid arthritis most commonly occur on the extensor surface of the forearm (Fig. 13.7), sites of pressure or friction such as the sacrum or Achilles tendon, or in the lungs. Multiple small nodules can occur in the hands. Rheumatoid nodules are strongly associated with a positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody or rheumatoid factor.\\\\nBony nodules in osteoarthritis affect the lateral aspects of the \\\\nDIP joints (Heberden\\\\u2019s nodes) or the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints (Bouchard\\\\u2019s nodes, Fig. 13.8).

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9361438751220703}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"bbf09738-89f9-4529-b469-7ed6b55f6a7a\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"553\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"710f9de4-2664-4787-909f-692abf1db92d\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"553\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"13575f8df810b6df9f3a594e91dcdf9e928efc6096fe2adaa08f1a4725c4904e\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"1bc2e6ea-95df-426f-b452-c8ca6ae5ac0c\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"553\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"51568a471c2fbaa292c8bebb1ae46f08eed89ce0c41edd2ab913c9b6307170ce\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"b1d7b5ee-429f-48eb-8824-1c09e5efc11e\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"528f28b99f565815db56d52fe711b45629f4d473e1f86a009fea6e2072eb970d\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\u2022Sexual history.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Ethnicity (eg SLE is commoner in African-\\\\nCaribbeans and Asians).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Ability to function (eg dressing, groom-ing, writing, w\\\\nalking).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Domestic situation, social support, home adap\\\\ntations.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Smoking (may worsen RA).\\\\n  \\\\u2022IBD.  \\\\u2022Pattern of involved joints.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Symmetry (or not).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Morning stiff  ness >30min (eg RA).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Pain, swelling, loss of function,  ery\\\\nthema, warmth.\\\\nExtra-articular features:\\\\n  \\\\u2022Rashes, photosensitivity (eg SLE).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Raynaud\\\\u2019s ( SLE;

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9361438751220703}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"bbf09738-89f9-4529-b469-7ed6b55f6a7a\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"553\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"710f9de4-2664-4787-909f-692abf1db92d\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"553\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"13575f8df810b6df9f3a594e91dcdf9e928efc6096fe2adaa08f1a4725c4904e\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"1bc2e6ea-95df-426f-b452-c8ca6ae5ac0c\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"553\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"51568a471c2fbaa292c8bebb1ae46f08eed89ce0c41edd2ab913c9b6307170ce\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"b1d7b5ee-429f-48eb-8824-1c09e5efc11e\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"528f28b99f565815db56d52fe711b45629f4d473e1f86a009fea6e2072eb970d\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\u2022Sexual history.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Ethnicity (eg SLE is commoner in African-\\\\nCaribbeans and Asians).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Ability to function (eg dressing, groom-ing, writing, w\\\\nalking).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Domestic situation, social support, home adap\\\\ntations.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Smoking (may worsen RA).\\\\n  \\\\u2022IBD.  \\\\u2022Pattern of involved joints.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Symmetry (or not).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Morning stiff  ness >30min (eg RA).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Pain, swelling, loss of function,  ery\\\\nthema, warmth.\\\\nExtra-articular features:\\\\n  \\\\u2022Rashes, photosensitivity (eg SLE).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Raynaud\\\\u2019s ( SLE;

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9361438751220703}], \\\"error\\\": null, \\\"perf\\\": {\\\"start_time\\\": \\\"2024-04-15T03:34:49.237577\\\", \\\"end_time\\\": \\\"2024-04-15T03:34:49.363168\\\"}, \\\"pid\\\": 14057, \\\"tid\\\": 14057}, {\\\"stack\\\": [{\\\"path\\\": \\\"app\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"TransformQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.transform_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137489892094544, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"query\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetrieverQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retriever_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137489892093632, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"query\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetrieverQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retriever_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137489892093632, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"retrieve\\\"}}], \\\"args\\\": {\\\"query_bundle\\\": {\\\"query_str\\\": \\\"you are a professional medical health service you have to provide three possible diseases and reasons why using bullet points as accurately as possible and based on the given context\\\\n                                    \\\\n                                    ENSURE THE RESPONSE REMAINS FAITHFUL TO THE PROVIDED CONTEXT.\\\\n                                    If you don\\\\u2019t know the answer to a question, please don\\\\u2019t share false information.\\\\n\\\\n                                    A patient presents with the following symptoms:\\\\n\\\\n                                    Yes, I have experienced pericarditis in the past.

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9361438751220703}], \\\"error\\\": null, \\\"perf\\\": {\\\"start_time\\\": \\\"2024-04-15T03:34:43.239339\\\", \\\"end_time\\\": \\\"2024-04-15T03:34:49.372269\\\"}, \\\"pid\\\": 14057, \\\"tid\\\": 14057}, {\\\"stack\\\": [{\\\"path\\\": \\\"app\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"TransformQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.transform_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137489892094544, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"query\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetrieverQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retriever_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137489892093632, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"query\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._response_synthesizer\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"CompactAndRefine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.response_synthesizers\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.response_synthesizers.compact_and_refine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137489892081920, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"get_response\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._response_synthesizer\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"Refine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.response_synthesizers\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.response_synthesizers.refine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137489892081920, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"get_response\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._response_synthesizer._llm\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"OpenAI\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.llms.openai\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.llms.openai.base\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137493229872416, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"wrapped_llm_chat\\\"}}], \\\"args\\\": {\\\"_self\\\": {\\\"callback_manager\\\": {\\\"__tru_non_serialized_object\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"CallbackManager\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.callbacks\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.callbacks.base\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137494657043376, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}}, \\\"system_prompt\\\": null, \\\"messages_to_prompt\\\": {\\\"__tru_non_serialized_object\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"function\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"builtins\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137493235211648, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}}, \\\"completion_to_prompt\\\": {\\\"__tru_non_serialized_object\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"function\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"builtins\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 137493235778032, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}}, \\\"output_parser\\\": null, \\\"pydantic_program_mode\\\": \\\"default\\\", \\\"query_wrapper_prompt\\\": null, \\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\\\", \\\"temperature\\\": 0.1, \\\"max_tokens\\\": null, \\\"logprobs\\\": null, \\\"top_logprobs\\\": 0, \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": {}, \\\"max_retries\\\": 3, \\\"timeout\\\": 60.0, \\\"default_headers\\\": null, \\\"reuse_client\\\": true, \\\"api_key\\\": \\\"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\\\", \\\"api_base\\\": \\\"https://api.openai.com/v1\\\", \\\"api_version\\\": \\\"\\\"}, \\\"messages\\\": [{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are an expert Q&A system that is trusted around the world.\\\\nAlways answer the query using the provided context information, and not prior knowledge.\\\\nSome rules to follow:\\\\n1.

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor.

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children.

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules \\\\nbut are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi -\\\\ntivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children.

\\\"text\\\": \\\"Mechanical pain is worse with use, develops at the end of the day and after activity, is relieved by rest and is accompanied by no or minimal morning stiffness (< 30minutes) and by swelling with no heat. Inflammatory pain worsens after rest, increases at the middle of the night or particularly in the morning, may improve with exercise and is accompanied by morn-ing stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes and signs of acute inflammation (rubor, tumor, calor, dolor et functia laesa). Migratory pain (one joint becoming \\\\ninflamed as another subsides) usually happens in rheumatic fever, gonococ-cal arthritis, meningococcal arhtritis, viral arthritis, SLE, acute leukemia and Whipple\\\\u2019s disease. Episodic recurrent pain is characteristic of palindromic rheumatism, Lyme disease, crystal induced arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Whipple\\\\u2019s disease, familial Mediterranean fever, Still\\\\u2019s disease and SLE. Pain is disproportionately greater than effusion in rheumatic fever, \\\\nFamilial Mediterranean fever, acute leukemia and AIDS. Sinovial effusion is disproportionately greater than pain in tuberculosis arthritis, bacterial endo-carditis, IBD, giant cell arteritis and Lyme disease. Referred pain happens in the following conditions: disease of the cervical spine can present with shoulder pain, shoulder disease \\\\u2013 with upper arm pain, lumbar spine lesions \\\\u2013 with hip or thigh pain and hip disease \\\\u2013 with knee pain.\\\\nSwelling may be due to bony hypertrophy, synovitis, intra-articular fluid, \\\\nor a swollen periarticular structure. Unlike tenderness, objective evidence of swelling indicates organic disease. In chronic rheumatic diseases impaired function is often due to a combination of pain, stiffness, tendon and joint damage, neurological impairment and muscle weakness.\\\\nA number of extrajoint manifestations can help to reveal the cause \\\\nof arthritis: Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon (in scleroderma and collagen vascu-\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 923, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2846, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9367243647575378}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"a7d9f167-f31f-4b13-a4ed-1f1006bbe66c\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"501599c0-0e4c-4e26-9100-3658e68139af\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"6775498bd1ea4ccd2872fef121238fe0722a1c51521b2f53696be7b3568095e4\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"54d10e28-12fc-4eef-b90e-efdc820172fd\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"db5ad70292912275329999c0dc5b83bbc9f68f37620f9e3ab7b66157a4f63a22\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"21c9aab8-438e-4063-8e09-16073e2e929f\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"e366b2cc1db49bfca2a6f5a5af634d3f7fc7d414d9d3575c3d950ede489334ea\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"Giving \\\\nO2 if breathless.

Alteration of discomfort after eating or antacids helps to distinguish oesophageal pain; cardiac pain is described on page 40.\\\\nCentral, constant, progressive, non-pleuritic chest pain may \\\\nrepresent\\\\tmediastinal \\\\tdisease,\\\\tparticularly \\\\tmalignancy. \\\\tSimilarly,\\\\t\\\\nchest wall pain (without trauma) that is constant, progressive and non-pleuritic suggests chest wall invasion by malignancy. Pain-induced sleep disturbance is a feature of such malignant pains.\\\\nFevers/rigors/night sweats\\\\nThese symptoms are not specific to respiratory medicine but are commonly reported by patients with respiratory diseases. Infection (acute or chronic) is the usual cause but other aetiologies such as lung cancer, lymphoma or vasculitis should also be considered.\\\\nPatients use a range of terms to describe fever (such as shivers, \\\\nchills, being \\\\u2018hot and bothered\\\\u2019, shakes), so ask for a detailed account of their symptoms using common terms.\\\\nRigors are generalised, uncontrollable episodes of vigorous \\\\nbody shaking lasting a few minutes. Despite high fever, the patient may complain of feeling cold and seek extra clothing. Rigors usually indicate bacterial sepsis; lobar pneumonia and acute pyelonephritis are the most common causes. They can be misinterpreted as seizures but the retention of consciousness and associated pyrexia suggest rigors.\\\\nNight sweats are more closely associated with chronic \\\\ninfection (such as tuberculosis) and malignancy or lymphoma rather than acute infection. Occasional episodes of a sweaty head or pillow are inconclusive, but if patients report having to change their nightclothes or sheets frequently due to profuse nocturnal sweating over several weeks, this is more likely to indicate underlying disease.\\\\nWeight loss\\\\nWeight loss is a common feature of several important respiratory diseases:\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t lung\\\\tcancers\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t chronic \\\\tinfective\\\\tdiseases\\\\t(such\\\\tas\\\\ttuberculosis \\\\tand\\\\t\\\\nbronchiectasis)\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t diseases \\\\tcausing\\\\tchronic\\\\tbreathlessness \\\\t(such\\\\tas\\\\tCOPD\\\\t\\\\nand interstitial lung diseases).\\\\nThe pathophysiology is complex; however, breathlessness \\\\nis associated with diminished appetite, and the systemic inflammatory response is also thought to contribute to weight loss.\\\\nSmall\\\\tamounts\\\\tof\\\\tweight\\\\tloss\\\\talso\\\\toccur\\\\tin\\\\tacute\\\\tinfection\\\\twith\\\\t\\\\nconsequent loss of appetite, particularly during hospitalisation. Ask the patient to estimate the extent and duration of weight loss, and enquire about appetite and dietary intake. Being underweight is a poor prognostic indicator in any chronic respiratory disease.\\\\nSleepiness\\\\nExcessive daytime sleepiness may be a symptom of an underlying \\\\nsleep-related \\\\tbreathing\\\\tdisorder\\\\t(obstructive \\\\tsleep\\\\tapnoea\\\\t(OSA)\\\\t\\\\nor\\\\tobstructive \\\\tsleep\\\\tapnoea/sleep \\\\thypopnoea \\\\t(OSASH)). \\\\tIn\\\\tthese\\\\t\\\\nconditions, frequent episodes of upper airway obstruction at night cause repeated microarousals from sleep, leading to complete disruption of normal sleep.

In adults, arthritis may be the only clinical feature of acute rheumatic fever and often occurs early. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 2003, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2715, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9303957223892212}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"8dc44eff-f8b6-4547-9702-752aec069fc3\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"428\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"21780d90-3106-4096-bb90-13afda3ab8a4\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"428\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"77b0a94fbdd73d3940d67b1a43843aa62430c3cc5c8d78267cf8c0e647f16264\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"9f756fcb-8b34-4b44-94ac-8334b84ab334\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"427\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"c80eb23750938cc9699b75703c0b0c762ba210c9bc344d4b7c19258b9f4fd8e1\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"82851ce9-3282-4d18-aad8-239262a255c9\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"a7417fc1c720ee1f7bfbd2375864338169351a9b1d1aa28595df4b5d817d19da\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"428 ChaPter\\\\u00a09  Joint, limb, and back\\\\nPolyarthritis\\\\nSeveral joints affected by pain, swelling, overlying redness, stiffness, and \\\\nlocal heat (\\\\u00b1 fever).

The early \\\\nhistory of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of \\\\nsynovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout.\\\\nSpondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their \\\\ncourse, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec -\\\\ntion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and \\\\nsacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic \\\\nLyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com -\\\\nmonly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic \\\\ntests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably \\\\nwith Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a \\\\npolyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is \\\\ncommon, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and \\\\nserologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec -\\\\ntion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly -\\\\narthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for \\\\nanti-CCP antibodies are negative.\\\\nMalar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope -\\\\ncia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or \\\\nSmith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point \\\\nto the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion -\\\\nally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these \\\\npatients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have \\\\nchiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the \\\\nshoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused \\\\nwith RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with \\\\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill. Uremic pericarditis \\\\ncan present with or without symptoms; fever is absent. \\\\nCMDT24_Ch10_p0321-p0395.indd   381 28/06/23   1:35 PM\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 532, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 5811, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9299196600914001}], \\\"error\\\": null, \\\"perf\\\": {\\\"start_time\\\": \\\"2024-04-14T12:33:24.442269\\\", \\\"end_time\\\": \\\"2024-04-14T12:33:25.554323\\\"}, \\\"pid\\\": 1637, \\\"tid\\\": 1637}, {\\\"stack\\\": [{\\\"path\\\": \\\"app\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetryQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retry_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584571342096, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"query\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._query_engine\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetrieverQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retriever_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584571341952, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"query\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._query_engine\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetrieverQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retriever_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584571341952, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"retrieve\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._query_engine._retriever\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"VectorIndexRetriever\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.indices.vector_store.retrievers\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.indices.vector_store.retrievers.retriever\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584571336624, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"retrieve\\\"}}], \\\"args\\\": {\\\"str_or_query_bundle\\\": {\\\"query_str\\\": \\\"A patient presents with the following symptoms:\\\\n\\\\n                    Yes, I have experienced pericarditis in the past.

\\\"text\\\": \\\"Mechanical pain is worse with use, develops at the end of the day and after activity, is relieved by rest and is accompanied by no or minimal morning stiffness (< 30minutes) and by swelling with no heat. Inflammatory pain worsens after rest, increases at the middle of the night or particularly in the morning, may improve with exercise and is accompanied by morn-ing stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes and signs of acute inflammation (rubor, tumor, calor, dolor et functia laesa). Migratory pain (one joint becoming \\\\ninflamed as another subsides) usually happens in rheumatic fever, gonococ-cal arthritis, meningococcal arhtritis, viral arthritis, SLE, acute leukemia and Whipple\\\\u2019s disease. Episodic recurrent pain is characteristic of palindromic rheumatism, Lyme disease, crystal induced arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Whipple\\\\u2019s disease, familial Mediterranean fever, Still\\\\u2019s disease and SLE. Pain is disproportionately greater than effusion in rheumatic fever, \\\\nFamilial Mediterranean fever, acute leukemia and AIDS. Sinovial effusion is disproportionately greater than pain in tuberculosis arthritis, bacterial endo-carditis, IBD, giant cell arteritis and Lyme disease. Referred pain happens in the following conditions: disease of the cervical spine can present with shoulder pain, shoulder disease \\\\u2013 with upper arm pain, lumbar spine lesions \\\\u2013 with hip or thigh pain and hip disease \\\\u2013 with knee pain.\\\\nSwelling may be due to bony hypertrophy, synovitis, intra-articular fluid, \\\\nor a swollen periarticular structure. Unlike tenderness, objective evidence of swelling indicates organic disease. In chronic rheumatic diseases impaired function is often due to a combination of pain, stiffness, tendon and joint damage, neurological impairment and muscle weakness.\\\\nA number of extrajoint manifestations can help to reveal the cause \\\\nof arthritis: Raynaud\\\\u2019s phenomenon (in scleroderma and collagen vascu-\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 923, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2846, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9367243647575378}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"a7d9f167-f31f-4b13-a4ed-1f1006bbe66c\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"501599c0-0e4c-4e26-9100-3658e68139af\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"6775498bd1ea4ccd2872fef121238fe0722a1c51521b2f53696be7b3568095e4\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"54d10e28-12fc-4eef-b90e-efdc820172fd\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"237\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Diagnosis.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 8573198, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"db5ad70292912275329999c0dc5b83bbc9f68f37620f9e3ab7b66157a4f63a22\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"21c9aab8-438e-4063-8e09-16073e2e929f\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"e366b2cc1db49bfca2a6f5a5af634d3f7fc7d414d9d3575c3d950ede489334ea\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"Giving \\\\nO2 if breathless.

Pain-induced sleep disturbance is a feature of such malignant pains.\\\\nFevers/rigors/night sweats\\\\nThese symptoms are not specific to respiratory medicine but are commonly reported by patients with respiratory diseases. Infection (acute or chronic) is the usual cause but other aetiologies such as lung cancer, lymphoma or vasculitis should also be considered.\\\\nPatients use a range of terms to describe fever (such as shivers, \\\\nchills, being \\\\u2018hot and bothered\\\\u2019, shakes), so ask for a detailed account of their symptoms using common terms.\\\\nRigors are generalised, uncontrollable episodes of vigorous \\\\nbody shaking lasting a few minutes. Despite high fever, the patient may complain of feeling cold and seek extra clothing. Rigors usually indicate bacterial sepsis; lobar pneumonia and acute pyelonephritis are the most common causes. They can be misinterpreted as seizures but the retention of consciousness and associated pyrexia suggest rigors.\\\\nNight sweats are more closely associated with chronic \\\\ninfection (such as tuberculosis) and malignancy or lymphoma rather than acute infection. Occasional episodes of a sweaty head or pillow are inconclusive, but if patients report having to change their nightclothes or sheets frequently due to profuse nocturnal sweating over several weeks, this is more likely to indicate underlying disease.\\\\nWeight loss\\\\nWeight loss is a common feature of several important respiratory diseases:\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t lung\\\\tcancers\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t chronic \\\\tinfective\\\\tdiseases\\\\t(such\\\\tas\\\\ttuberculosis \\\\tand\\\\t\\\\nbronchiectasis)\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t diseases \\\\tcausing\\\\tchronic\\\\tbreathlessness \\\\t(such\\\\tas\\\\tCOPD\\\\t\\\\nand interstitial lung diseases).\\\\nThe pathophysiology is complex; however, breathlessness \\\\nis associated with diminished appetite, and the systemic inflammatory response is also thought to contribute to weight loss.\\\\nSmall\\\\tamounts\\\\tof\\\\tweight\\\\tloss\\\\talso\\\\toccur\\\\tin\\\\tacute\\\\tinfection\\\\twith\\\\t\\\\nconsequent loss of appetite, particularly during hospitalisation.

This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9302325248718262}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"cc55d87b-7b5c-4cde-84f4-1cfebfc318fe\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"381\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"aa5708fa-c563-4002-84c0-ae0c9be846c9\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"381\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"38bce9861bd443d73e726c1ea909438aa25f8bee8cda169677abb51c156cf95d\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"932547ca-ee54-4f97-895a-59c8095811cb\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"381\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"f37bcf5913388de17b8a21c924805696d786522513f242af02612f50070bc890\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"b04af6ca-b365-4bff-8f16-1f26d2cdcbb3\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"2550d6764b2ccf1af92c7c2b216d2ad40f2a00bf81f82507c2d22dde5610f120\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\u00bbESR or inflammatory CRP usually elevated.\\\\n \\\\u00bbECG reveals diffuse ST-segment elevation with \\\\nassociated PR depression.\\\\n \\\\u00bbGeneral Considerations\\\\nAcute (less than 2 weeks) inflammation of the pericardium \\\\nmay be infectious in origin or may be due to systemic dis -\\\\neases (autoimmune syndromes, uremia), neoplasm, radia -\\\\ntion, drug toxicity, hemopericardium, postcardiac surgery, \\\\nor contiguous inflammatory processes in the myocardium \\\\nor lung. In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill. Uremic pericarditis \\\\ncan present with or without symptoms; fever is absent. \\\\nCMDT24_Ch10_p0321-p0395.indd   381 28/06/23   1:35 PM\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 532, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 5811, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9299196600914001}], \\\"error\\\": null, \\\"perf\\\": {\\\"start_time\\\": \\\"2024-04-14T12:33:24.234815\\\", \\\"end_time\\\": \\\"2024-04-14T12:33:25.573212\\\"}, \\\"pid\\\": 1637, \\\"tid\\\": 1637}, {\\\"stack\\\": [{\\\"path\\\": \\\"app\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetryQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retry_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584571342096, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"query\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._query_engine\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetrieverQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retriever_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584571341952, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"query\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._query_engine\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RetrieverQueryEngine\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.query_engine.retriever_query_engine\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584571341952, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"retrieve\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._query_engine._node_postprocessors[0]\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"RankGPTRerank\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.postprocessor.rankgpt_rerank\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.postprocessor.rankgpt_rerank.base\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584570529984, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"_postprocess_nodes\\\"}}, {\\\"path\\\": \\\"app._query_engine._query_engine._node_postprocessors[0].llm\\\", \\\"method\\\": {\\\"obj\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"OpenAI\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.llms.openai\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.llms.openai.base\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584570046048, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}, \\\"name\\\": \\\"wrapped_llm_chat\\\"}}], \\\"args\\\": {\\\"_self\\\": {\\\"callback_manager\\\": {\\\"__tru_non_serialized_object\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"CallbackManager\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.callbacks\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"llama_index.core.callbacks.base\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138584571339888, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}}, \\\"system_prompt\\\": null, \\\"messages_to_prompt\\\": {\\\"__tru_non_serialized_object\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"function\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"builtins\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138590120222656, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}}, \\\"completion_to_prompt\\\": {\\\"__tru_non_serialized_object\\\": {\\\"cls\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"function\\\", \\\"module\\\": {\\\"package_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"module_name\\\": \\\"builtins\\\"}, \\\"bases\\\": null}, \\\"id\\\": 138590118724656, \\\"init_bindings\\\": null}}, \\\"output_parser\\\": null, \\\"pydantic_program_mode\\\": \\\"default\\\", \\\"query_wrapper_prompt\\\": null, \\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\\\", \\\"temperature\\\": 0.0, \\\"max_tokens\\\": null, \\\"logprobs\\\": null, \\\"top_logprobs\\\": 0, \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": {}, \\\"max_retries\\\": 3, \\\"timeout\\\": 60.0, \\\"default_headers\\\": null, \\\"reuse_client\\\": true, \\\"api_key\\\": \\\"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\\\", \\\"api_base\\\": \\\"https://api.openai.com/v1\\\", \\\"api_version\\\": \\\"\\\"}, \\\"messages\\\": [{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are RankGPT, an intelligent assistant that can rank passages based on their relevancy to the query.\\\", \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": {}}, {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"I will provide you with 12 passages, each indicated by number identifier []. \\\\nRank the passages based on their relevance to query: A patient presents with the following symptoms:\\\\n\\\\n                    Yes, I have experienced pericarditis in the past.

Ask about, and examine for, extra-articular features: skin and nail (see p 76) involvement (include scalp, hairline, umbilicus, genitalia, and natal cleft \\\\u2014psoriasis can easily be missed); eye signs (see p 560); lungs (eg \\\\ufb01 brosis) (see p 198); kidneys (see p 314); heart; GI (eg mouth ulcers, diarrhoea); GU (eg urethritis, genital ulcers); and CNS.

Other symptoms\\\\u2014 Interstitial lung disease is often asymptomatic and detected only by chest imaging, but it can be clinically significant in about 10% of patients. Peri - carditis and pleural disease are usually silent clinically, but symptomatic effusions can develop. Occasionally, a small- vessel vasculitis develops and manifests as tiny hemorrhagic infarcts in the nail folds or finger pulps. Necrotizing arteri - tis is well reported but rare. A small subset of patients with RA have splenomegaly and neutropenia (Felty syndrome), usually in the setting of untreated severe, destructive arthri - tis.

Alteration of discomfort after eating or antacids helps to distinguish oesophageal pain; cardiac pain is described on page 40. Central, constant, progressive, non-pleuritic chest pain may represent mediastinal disease, particularly malignancy. Similarly, chest wall pain (without trauma) that is constant, progressive and non-pleuritic suggests chest wall invasion by malignancy. Pain-induced sleep disturbance is a feature of such malignant pains. Fevers/rigors/night sweats These symptoms are not specific to respiratory medicine but are commonly reported by patients with respiratory diseases. Infection (acute or chronic) is the usual cause but other aetiologies such as lung cancer, lymphoma or vasculitis should also be considered. Patients use a range of terms to describe fever (such as shivers, chills, being \\\\u2018hot and bothered\\\\u2019, shakes), so ask for a detailed account of their symptoms using common terms. Rigors are generalised, uncontrollable episodes of vigorous body shaking lasting a few minutes. Despite high fever, the patient may complain of feeling cold and seek extra clothing. Rigors usually indicate bacterial sepsis; lobar pneumonia and acute pyelonephritis are the most common causes. They can be misinterpreted as seizures but the retention of consciousness and associated pyrexia suggest rigors. Night sweats are more closely associated with chronic infection (such as tuberculosis) and malignancy or lymphoma rather than acute infection. Occasional episodes of a sweaty head or pillow are inconclusive, but if patients report having to change their nightclothes or sheets frequently due to profuse nocturnal sweating over several weeks, this is more likely to indicate underlying disease.

Gouty tophi can resemble rheumatoid nodules but are not associated with rheumatoid factor, whose sensi - tivity for rheumatoid nodules approaches 100%. The early history of intermittent monoarthritis and the presence of synovial urate crystals are distinctive features of gout. Spondyloarthropathies, particularly earlier in their course, can be a source of diagnostic uncertainty; predilec - tion for lower extremities and involvement of the spine and sacroiliac joints point to the correct diagnosis. Chronic Lyme arthritis typically involves only one joint, most com - monly the knee, and is associated with positive serologic tests (see Chapter 36). Acute viral infections, most notably with Chikungunya virus and parvovirus B19, can cause a polyarthritis that mimics early-onset RA. However, fever is common, the arthritis usually resolves within weeks, and serologic studies confirm recent infection. Chronic infec - tion with hepatitis C can cause a chronic nonerosive poly - arthritis associated with rheumatoid factor; tests for anti-CCP antibodies are negative. Malar rash, photosensitivity, discoid skin lesions, alope - cia, high titer antibodies to double-stranded DNA or Smith, glomerulonephritis, and CNS abnormalities point to the diagnosis of SLE. Polymyalgia rheumatica occasion - ally causes polyarthralgias in patients over age 50, but these patients remain rheumatoid factor\\\\u2013negative and have chiefly proximal muscle pain and stiffness, centered on the shoulder and hip girdles. Joint pain that can be confused with RA presents in a substantial minority of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. This diagnostic error can be avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the arthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially involves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually spares the small joints of the hand.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro - cess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. Overall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis - sions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest pain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 proposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, current, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic criteria. In acute pericarditis, there are four criteria: (1) pericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide - spread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or worsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis of acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must be present. Incessant pericarditis is defined by its dura - tion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months without remission. Recurrent pericarditis can be diag - nosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis who has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, chronic pericarditis is diagnosed when it persists for more than 3 months. Viral infections (especially infections with coxsackie - viruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, varicella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most common cause of acute pericarditis and probably are responsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. COVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi - tis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age 50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected.

Pain-induced sleep disturbance is a feature of such malignant pains.\\\\nFevers/rigors/night sweats\\\\nThese symptoms are not specific to respiratory medicine but are commonly reported by patients with respiratory diseases. Infection (acute or chronic) is the usual cause but other aetiologies such as lung cancer, lymphoma or vasculitis should also be considered.\\\\nPatients use a range of terms to describe fever (such as shivers, \\\\nchills, being \\\\u2018hot and bothered\\\\u2019, shakes), so ask for a detailed account of their symptoms using common terms.\\\\nRigors are generalised, uncontrollable episodes of vigorous \\\\nbody shaking lasting a few minutes. Despite high fever, the patient may complain of feeling cold and seek extra clothing. Rigors usually indicate bacterial sepsis; lobar pneumonia and acute pyelonephritis are the most common causes. They can be misinterpreted as seizures but the retention of consciousness and associated pyrexia suggest rigors.\\\\nNight sweats are more closely associated with chronic \\\\ninfection (such as tuberculosis) and malignancy or lymphoma rather than acute infection. Occasional episodes of a sweaty head or pillow are inconclusive, but if patients report having to change their nightclothes or sheets frequently due to profuse nocturnal sweating over several weeks, this is more likely to indicate underlying disease.\\\\nWeight loss\\\\nWeight loss is a common feature of several important respiratory diseases:\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t lung\\\\tcancers\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t chronic \\\\tinfective\\\\tdiseases\\\\t(such\\\\tas\\\\ttuberculosis \\\\tand\\\\t\\\\nbronchiectasis)\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\t diseases \\\\tcausing\\\\tchronic\\\\tbreathlessness \\\\t(such\\\\tas\\\\tCOPD\\\\t\\\\nand interstitial lung diseases).\\\\nThe pathophysiology is complex; however, breathlessness \\\\nis associated with diminished appetite, and the systemic inflammatory response is also thought to contribute to weight loss.\\\\nSmall\\\\tamounts\\\\tof\\\\tweight\\\\tloss\\\\talso\\\\toccur\\\\tin\\\\tacute\\\\tinfection\\\\twith\\\\t\\\\nconsequent loss of appetite, particularly during hospitalisation.

This diagnostic error can \\\\nbe avoided by recognizing that, in contrast to RA, the \\\\narthritis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis preferentially \\\\ninvolves larger joints (eg, hips, ankles, wrists) and usually \\\\nspares the small joints of the hand. Rheumatic fever is \\\\ncharacterized by the migratory nature of the arthritis, an \\\\nelevated antistreptolysin titer, and a more dramatic and \\\\nprompt response to aspirin; carditis and erythema margin -\\\\natum may occur in adults, but chorea and subcutaneous \\\\nnodules occur only in children. Finally, a variety of cancers \\\\nproduce paraneoplastic syndromes, including polyarthri -\\\\ntis. One form is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy \\\\nmost often produced by lung and GI carcinomas, charac -\\\\nterized by a rheumatoid-like arthritis associated with club -\\\\nbing, periosteal new bone formation, and a negative \\\\nrheumatoid factor. Diffuse swelling of the hands with pal -\\\\nmar fasciitis occurs in a variety of cancers, especially ovar -\\\\nian carcinoma.\\\\n \\\\u00bbTreatment\\\\nThe primary objectives in treating RA are reduction of \\\\ninflammation and pain, preservation of function, and pre -\\\\nvention of deformity. \\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 2856, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9302325248718262}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"cc55d87b-7b5c-4cde-84f4-1cfebfc318fe\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"381\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"aa5708fa-c563-4002-84c0-ae0c9be846c9\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"381\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"38bce9861bd443d73e726c1ea909438aa25f8bee8cda169677abb51c156cf95d\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"932547ca-ee54-4f97-895a-59c8095811cb\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"381\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2024.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 27678591, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-04\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"f37bcf5913388de17b8a21c924805696d786522513f242af02612f50070bc890\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"b04af6ca-b365-4bff-8f16-1f26d2cdcbb3\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"2550d6764b2ccf1af92c7c2b216d2ad40f2a00bf81f82507c2d22dde5610f120\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\u00bbESR or inflammatory CRP usually elevated.\\\\n \\\\u00bbECG reveals diffuse ST-segment elevation with \\\\nassociated PR depression.\\\\n \\\\u00bbGeneral Considerations\\\\nAcute (less than 2 weeks) inflammation of the pericardium \\\\nmay be infectious in origin or may be due to systemic dis -\\\\neases (autoimmune syndromes, uremia), neoplasm, radia -\\\\ntion, drug toxicity, hemopericardium, postcardiac surgery, \\\\nor contiguous inflammatory processes in the myocardium \\\\nor lung. In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill. Uremic pericarditis \\\\ncan present with or without symptoms; fever is absent. \\\\nCMDT24_Ch10_p0321-p0395.indd   381 28/06/23   1:35 PM\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 532, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 5811, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9299196600914001}], \\\"query_bundle\\\": {\\\"query_str\\\": \\\"A patient presents with the following symptoms:\\\\n\\\\n                    Yes, I have experienced pericarditis in the past.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill. Uremic pericarditis \\\\ncan present with or without symptoms; fever is absent. \\\\nCMDT24_Ch10_p0321-p0395.indd   381 28/06/23   1:35 PM\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 532, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 5811, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9299196600914001}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"925041c6-9fb6-4ce6-a350-2ce672fb09c2\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"168\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"d40cbe23-088f-47c2-9493-60ba693ab400\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"168\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"e055b17ca6dde9261ab9682f27abd25d0ae04ee31c5b1af336456c929b78acfd\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"ef8b769b-eb55-4d9f-b843-1a0964525882\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"168\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"3ae41be0bf56798f98ad71e4a79b2e79b3027f56646fa94387c42dca21bdd928\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"f85b885d-d4f3-4e8a-a145-a9ce5a209915\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"af5a2b925c02397285e547e672dd62bf8b329683fca304067ef5bdc8be4e2a68\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\u2022Autoimmune: systemic autoimmune diseases eg SLE, RA; vasculitides eg Beh\\\\u00e7et, \\\\nTakayasu; IBD; sarcoid; amyloid; Dressler\\\\u2019s (p 698).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Drugs: eg procainamide, hydralazine, penicillin, isoniazid, chemotherapy.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Metabolic: uraemia, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Others: trauma, surgery, malignancy, radiotherapy, MI, chronic heart failure.\\\\nClinical features: Central chest pain worse on inspiration or lying \\\\ufb02  at \\\\u00b1 r elief by \\\\nsitting forward.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill. Uremic pericarditis \\\\ncan present with or without symptoms; fever is absent. \\\\nCMDT24_Ch10_p0321-p0395.indd   381 28/06/23   1:35 PM\\\", \\\"page_label: 168\\\\nfile_path: /content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022Autoimmune: systemic autoimmune diseases eg SLE, RA; vasculitides eg Beh\\\\u00e7et, \\\\nTakayasu; IBD; sarcoid; amyloid; Dressler\\\\u2019s (p 698).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Drugs: eg procainamide, hydralazine, penicillin, isoniazid, chemotherapy.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Metabolic: uraemia, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Others: trauma, surgery, malignancy, radiotherapy, MI, chronic heart failure.\\\\nClinical features: Central chest pain worse on inspiration or lying \\\\ufb02  at \\\\u00b1 r elief by \\\\nsitting forward.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill.

could indicate pericarditis, especially considering the patient's history of experiencing it in the past.\\\\\\\\n- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): The joint pain in the wrists and shoulders could be indicative of RA, which is an autoimmune disease that can present with joint pain and inflammation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTreatment for each disease:\\\\\\\\n- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The patient should seek medical attention for SLE. Treatment typically involves medications to manage symptoms and prevent flare-ups, such as corticosteroids, antimalarial drugs, and immunosuppressants.\\\\\\\\n- Pericarditis: Given the symptoms and history of pericarditis, it is advisable for the patient to seek medical attention. Treatment for pericarditis may include NSAIDs, colchicine, and in some cases, corticosteroids.\\\\\\\\n- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): If RA is suspected, it is recommended for the patient to consult a healthcare professional.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\n\\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction.

Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill. Uremic pericarditis \\\\ncan present with or without symptoms; fever is absent. \\\\nCMDT24_Ch10_p0321-p0395.indd   381 28/06/23   1:35 PM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022Autoimmune: systemic autoimmune diseases eg SLE, RA; vasculitides eg Beh\\\\u00e7et, \\\\nTakayasu; IBD; sarcoid; amyloid; Dressler\\\\u2019s (p 698).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Drugs: eg procainamide, hydralazine, penicillin, isoniazid, chemotherapy.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Metabolic: uraemia, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Others: trauma, surgery, malignancy, radiotherapy, MI, chronic heart failure.\\\\nClinical features: Central chest pain worse on inspiration or lying \\\\ufb02  at \\\\u00b1 r elief by \\\\nsitting forward.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\\\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\\\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\\\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\\\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\\\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\\\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\\\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\\\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\\\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\\\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\\\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\\\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\\\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\\\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\\\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\\\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\\\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\\\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\\\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\\\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\\\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\\\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\\\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\\\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\\\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\\\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\\\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\\\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\\\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\\\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\\\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\\\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\\\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\\\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\\\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\\\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\\\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\\\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\\\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\\\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\\\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\\\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\\\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\\\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\\\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\\\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\\\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\\\\\noccluder devices).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\\\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\\\\\nconstriction.

Treatment for pericarditis may include NSAIDs, colchicine, and in some cases, corticosteroids.\\\\n- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): If RA is suspected, it is recommended for the patient to consult a healthcare professional.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\n\\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction.

Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill. Uremic pericarditis \\\\ncan present with or without symptoms; fever is absent. \\\\nCMDT24_Ch10_p0321-p0395.indd   381 28/06/23   1:35 PM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022Autoimmune: systemic autoimmune diseases eg SLE, RA; vasculitides eg Beh\\\\u00e7et, \\\\nTakayasu; IBD; sarcoid; amyloid; Dressler\\\\u2019s (p 698).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Drugs: eg procainamide, hydralazine, penicillin, isoniazid, chemotherapy.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Metabolic: uraemia, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Others: trauma, surgery, malignancy, radiotherapy, MI, chronic heart failure.\\\\nClinical features: Central chest pain worse on inspiration or lying \\\\ufb02  at \\\\u00b1 r elief by \\\\nsitting forward.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 0, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 3993, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": null}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"e304107e-c6b5-4850-9f74-81bb8f6ad006\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"91f2d66b-0e0c-4b4c-98b2-1f8ec4c593b0\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"25cfcdac492a0d0c02b3e03823fb7f537ded9269e8864adb6ad8b3ea33e9c540\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"094aceea-0bbf-42aa-bcff-062c075e221a\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"0ee23ce568fec557989815bf2beb4180d6104e8ca0810894a0d34a8761c9438b\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"cbadd990-2721-401c-9488-232f126c8eda\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"4b7edfa89f889b9bd2f53d73a30613b1c5c44a8e6ad820b7a5f75b832ac3a72f\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"Radiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction.

A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months.

In many of these conditions, the pathologic pro -\\\\ncess involves both the pericardium and the myocardium. \\\\nOverall pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of hospital admis -\\\\nsions and about 5% of patients with nonischemic chest \\\\npain seen in the emergency department. The ESC in 2015 \\\\nproposed four categories of pericarditis: acute, incessant, \\\\ncurrent, and chronic. Each category has its own diagnostic \\\\ncriteria. In acute pericarditis,  there are four criteria: (1) \\\\npericardial chest pain, (2) pericardial rub, (3) new wide -\\\\nspread ST elevation or PR depression, and (4) new or \\\\nworsening pericardial effusion. To establish the diagnosis \\\\nof acute pericarditis, at least two of these four criteria must \\\\nbe present. Incessant pericarditis  is defined by its dura -\\\\ntion; it lasts longer than 4\\\\u20136 weeks but less than 3 months \\\\nwithout remission. Recurrent pericarditis  can be diag -\\\\nnosed in a patient with one reported episode of pericarditis \\\\nwho has been symptom free for at least 4\\\\u20136 weeks. Finally, \\\\nchronic pericarditis  is diagnosed when it persists for more \\\\nthan 3 months.\\\\nViral infections  (especially infections with coxsackie -\\\\nviruses and echoviruses but also influenza, Epstein-Barr, \\\\nvaricella, hepatitis, mumps, and HIV viruses) are the most \\\\ncommon cause of acute pericarditis and probably are \\\\nresponsible for many cases classified as idiopathic. \\\\nCOVID-19 has been associated with both acute pericardi -\\\\ntis and even cardiac tamponade. Males\\\\u2014usually under age \\\\n50 years\\\\u2014are most commonly affected. The differential \\\\ndiagnosis primarily requires exclusion of acute MI. Tuberculous pericarditis  is rare in developed countries \\\\nbut remains common in certain areas of the world. It \\\\nresults from direct lymphatic or hematogenous spread; \\\\nclinical pulmonary involvement may be absent or minor, \\\\nalthough associated pleural effusions are common. Bacte -\\\\nrial pericarditis  is equally rare and usually results from \\\\ndirect extension from pulmonary infections. Pneumococci, \\\\nthough, can cause a primary pericardial infection. Borrelia \\\\nburgdorferi,  the organism responsible for Lyme disease, can \\\\nalso cause myopericarditis (and occasionally heart block). \\\\nUremic pericarditis  is a common complication of CKD. \\\\nThe pathogenesis is uncertain; it occurs both with untreated \\\\nuremia and in otherwise stable dialysis patients. Spread of \\\\nadjacent lung cancer as well as invasion by breast cancer, \\\\nrenal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and lymphomas are \\\\nthe most common neoplastic processes  involving the peri -\\\\ncardium and have become the most frequent causes of \\\\npericardial tamponade in many countries. Pericarditis may \\\\noccur 2\\\\u20135 days after infarction due to an inflammatory \\\\nreaction to transmural myocardial necrosis (post-MI  or \\\\npostcardiotomy pericarditis [Dressler syndrome]). \\\\nRadiation  can initiate a fibrinous and fibrotic process in \\\\nthe pericardium, presenting as subacute pericarditis or \\\\nconstriction. Radiation pericarditis usually follows treat -\\\\nments of more than 4000 cGy delivered to ports including \\\\nmore than 30% of the heart.\\\\nOther causes of pericarditis include connective tissue \\\\ndiseases,  such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, drug-\\\\ninduced pericarditis  (minoxidil, penicillins, clozapine), \\\\nand myxedema.  In addition, pericarditis may result from \\\\npericardial injury  from invasive cardiac procedures (such \\\\nas cardiac pacemaker and defibrillator perforation and \\\\nintracardiac ablation, especially atrial fibrillation ablation), \\\\nand the implantation of intracardiac devices (such as ASD \\\\noccluder devices).\\\\nPericarditis and myocarditis may coexist in 20\\\\u201330% of \\\\npatients. Myocarditis is often suspected when there is an \\\\nelevation of serum troponins, although there are no data \\\\nthat suggest troponin elevations are associated with a poor \\\\nprognosis.\\\\n \\\\u00bbClinical Findings\\\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\\\nThe presentation and course of inflammatory pericarditis \\\\ndepend on its cause, but most syndromes have associated \\\\nchest pain, which is usually pleuritic and postural (relieved \\\\nby sitting). The pain is substernal but may radiate to the \\\\nneck, shoulders, back, or epigastrium. Dyspnea may also \\\\nbe present and the patient is often febrile. A pericardial \\\\nfriction rub  is characteristic, with or without evidence of \\\\nfluid accumulation or constriction. The presentation of \\\\ntuberculous pericarditis tends to be subacute, but nonspe -\\\\ncific symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) may be present \\\\nfor days to months. Pericardial involvement develops in \\\\n1\\\\u20138% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms \\\\nand signs of bacterial pericarditis are similar to those of \\\\nother types of inflammatory pericarditis, but patients \\\\nappear toxic and are often critically ill. Uremic pericarditis \\\\ncan present with or without symptoms; fever is absent. \\\\nCMDT24_Ch10_p0321-p0395.indd   381 28/06/23   1:35 PM\\\", \\\"start_char_idx\\\": 532, \\\"end_char_idx\\\": 5811, \\\"text_template\\\": \\\"{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}\\\", \\\"metadata_template\\\": \\\"{key}: {value}\\\", \\\"metadata_seperator\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}, \\\"score\\\": 0.9299196600914001}, {\\\"node\\\": {\\\"id_\\\": \\\"925041c6-9fb6-4ce6-a350-2ce672fb09c2\\\", \\\"embedding\\\": null, \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"168\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\\\": [\\\"file_name\\\", \\\"file_type\\\", \\\"file_size\\\", \\\"creation_date\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\", \\\"last_accessed_date\\\"], \\\"relationships\\\": {\\\"1\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"d40cbe23-088f-47c2-9493-60ba693ab400\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"4\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"168\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"e055b17ca6dde9261ab9682f27abd25d0ae04ee31c5b1af336456c929b78acfd\\\"}, \\\"2\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"ef8b769b-eb55-4d9f-b843-1a0964525882\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"page_label\\\": \\\"168\\\", \\\"file_name\\\": \\\"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_path\\\": \\\"/content/drive/MyDrive/tensorflow_project/Disease Prediction/data/4.5 - Multilingual USE/Documents/Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine.pdf\\\", \\\"file_type\\\": \\\"application/pdf\\\", \\\"file_size\\\": 33003268, \\\"creation_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\", \\\"last_modified_date\\\": \\\"2024-04-10\\\"}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"3ae41be0bf56798f98ad71e4a79b2e79b3027f56646fa94387c42dca21bdd928\\\"}, \\\"3\\\": {\\\"node_id\\\": \\\"f85b885d-d4f3-4e8a-a145-a9ce5a209915\\\", \\\"node_type\\\": \\\"1\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": {}, \\\"hash\\\": \\\"af5a2b925c02397285e547e672dd62bf8b329683fca304067ef5bdc8be4e2a68\\\"}}, \\\"text\\\": \\\"\\\\u2022Autoimmune: systemic autoimmune diseases eg SLE, RA; vasculitides eg Beh\\\\u00e7et, \\\\nTakayasu; IBD; sarcoid; amyloid; Dressler\\\\u2019s (p 698).\\\\n  \\\\u2022Drugs: eg procainamide, hydralazine, penicillin, isoniazid, chemotherapy.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Metabolic: uraemia, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa.\\\\n  \\\\u2022Others: trauma, surgery, malignancy, radiotherapy, MI, chronic heart failure.\\\\nClinical features: Central chest pain worse on inspiration or lying \\\\ufb02  at \\\\u00b1 r elief by \\\\nsitting forward.
